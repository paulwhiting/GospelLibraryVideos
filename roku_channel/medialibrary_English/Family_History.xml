        <title>Time Well Spent</title>
        <description>A couple in England shares how doing family history work has enhanced their experiences in the temple. They show the application of a principle outlined by Elder Richard G. Scott that "any work you do in the temple is time well spent, but receiving ordinances vicariously for one of your own ancestors will make the time in the temple more sacred." To get started finding your family members needing temple saving ordinances, visit FamilySearch.org.</description>
